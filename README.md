# Technical Assessment: Voting Application Dashboard

## Project Overview

Develop a web-based Voting Application Dashboard. This app provides a basic voting platform with a dashboard for visualizing real-time or aggregated results. No user roles or authentication are required; all users share the same voting interface. The assessment can be completed in one of three ways—frontend-only, backend-focused, or balanced full-stack—depending on your skillset and preference[web:16].

---

## Path 1: Frontend-Only

### Goal

Build a stand-alone UI that is modern, intuitive, and wholly original (no clone-vibes). The data should be mocked—no backend or live connectivity required.

### Requirements

- **Dashboard Visualization**
  - Display total votes, percentages, and dynamic charts (bar, pie, donut, etc.) for selected voting items[web:24].
  - Adaptively show stats for varying dataset sizes (100–10,000+ records).

- **Navigation Simulation**
  - Implement a navbar or button cluster representing different site sections (Results, History, Submit Vote, Analysis).
  - Only dashboard needs to be functional; other buttons/pages should simply display relevant UI elements or state transitions without real navigation.

- **Responsive Layout and UX**
  - Fully responsive for desktop/tablet/mobile[web:4].
  - Smooth transitions between visual states and clear feedback for loading/error/success.
  - Use accessibility best practices (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, labeled charts).

- **Static Mock Data**
  - Hardcode or link a JSON dataset representing thousands of votes.
  - All data interactions reference this local dataset.

- **Code Quality**
  - Clean, readable, and well-documented codebase.
  - Original design—avoid obvious framework templates.
  - Effective error handling for missing or malformed data.

### Evaluation Criteria

- UI/UX polish and originality.
- Accessibility and responsiveness.
- Code clarity, structure, documentation.
- Effective state management and error handling.

## Path 2: Backend-Focused

### Goal

Deliver a high-performance backend capable of storing, processing, and analyzing large voting datasets. The frontend should be minimal—mainly for displaying results or submitting new data.

### Requirements

- **API Design**
  - RESTful endpoints for:
    - Bulk vote submissions (array/batch upload)[web:16].
    - Vote statistics (counts, percentages, top candidates).
    - Fetch specific candidate/item results or raw vote data.
  - All endpoints handle invalid, duplicate, or malformed data gracefully (e.g., rejecting duplicates with clear messages).

- **Data Persistence**
  - Store all votes in a database—any system or ORM is allowed (PostgreSQL preferred for relational).
  - Efficient schema supporting high-volume inserts and reads.

- **Performance & Reliability**
  - API does not crash or break, regardless of bad input or dataset size.
  - Document or supply scripts to **stress-test** with at least 100,000 records:
    - Measure performance for both ingestion and statistics retrieval.

- **Minimal Frontend**
  - Basic HTML/JS or framework-based page for:
    - Bulk CSV/JSON dataset upload (or manual entry).
    - Viewing dashboard analytics from backend responses.
  - No need for advanced styling or navigation.

- **Documentation**
  - API reference with sample requests/responses.
  - Setup guides for backend and demo frontend.
  - Instructions for stress test/benchmark reproducibility.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Reliability and bulk data handling (API never breaks).
- Efficient storage and retrieval logic.
- RESTful API structure and clear documentation.
- Minimal but usable frontend.

## Path 3: Balanced Full-Stack

### Goal

Build a cohesive voting app that “just works”—functional dashboard, pleasant user interactions, and solid backend logic. No need for standout UI/UX or advanced backend protection; focus on usability and completeness.

### Requirements

- **Frontend**
  - Simple interface for submitting votes and viewing aggregated results.
  - Responsive, with clear feedback for every action (error, success, loading).

- **Backend**
  - Reliable API for accepting, storing, and analyzing votes (batch or individual).
  - Returns clean errors for invalid/duplicate submissions.

- **Data Workflow**
  - Demonstrate a clean workflow: submit votes → view stats.
  - Handles realistic edge cases without breaking (e.g., multiple users voting for the same candidate, odd data formats, missing values).

- **Documentation**
  - Clear setup and usage instructions for both sides.
  - Explain how data validation and error handling are designed.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Usability and workflow clarity.
- Code maintainability (clean organization, commenting).
- Cohesion between frontend and backend.
- Graceful error handling and completeness.

## Core Assessment Criteria

- **Requirements Documentation**: Well-defined objectives for chosen assessment path.
- **Working Codebase**: Setup/run instructions for all components.
- **Demo Dataset**: Ready-to-use JSON or CSV file (10,000+ votes recommended). This Dataset will be given to you 
- **Commit History & Comments**: Readable history, good inline documentation.
- **Bonus Features**:
  - Data import/export (e.g., upload/load/download CSV/JSON).
  - Dashboard export (charts as image/PDF).
  - Simple automated tests (unit/integration).

## Notes

- Authentication/user roles are **not** required.
- Focus strongly on reliability, UX (if applicable), bulk data handling, and comprehensive documentation.
- Use any modern stack or technology.
- Deliverables should be easy to evaluate for code quality, clarity, and robustness.
